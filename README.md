# pipex

## Description

pipex is a project at 42 that involves creating a simple program to mimic the functionality of the shell command `pipe` (`|`). The goal is to execute two commands in two separate processes and redirect the output of the first command as input to the second command.

## Base Features

- Implements basic shell functionality with pipes.
- Handles simple command execution in two processes.
- Supports input/output redirection.

## Bonus Functionality

The bonus part of pipex enhances the basic functionality with the following features:

- **Multiple Pipes**: Ability to use multiple pipes in succession (`cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3 ...`), which enables complex command line data processing.
- **Here_doc**: Implements `here_doc` functionality to allow for inline data entry that can be used as input to the command chain.

## Usage 

To clone the repository use:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hlibine/pipex.git
```
Compilation & cleanup:

- `make` : Compiles the standard code.
- `make bonus` : Compiles the bonus code.
- `make clean` : Cleans up all the files except for the executable.
- `make fclean` : Cleans up all files generated by running make.

Example usage of standard pipex:
```bash
./pipex infile "ls -l" "wc -l" outfile
```
Example usage of pipex with bonus features:
```bash
./pipex infile "ls -l" "grep .c" "wc -l" outfile  # multiple pipes
./pipex here_doc LIMITER "cmd1" "cmd2" outfile    # here_doc
```
